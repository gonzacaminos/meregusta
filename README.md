# meregusta

An old University project, **meregusta** is an interactive installation written in **Processing + Arduino** that pings a Facebook page and waters a plant if the likes have increased.

Everytime the Processing app finds a positive difference on likes it will command the Arduino to open a water valve that in turn will water a plant thus converting Likes in Water.
